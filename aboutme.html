        <h2>About meüßç</h2>
        <p>Hello üòé,
          My name is Oscar and I am software engineering student at Chalmers university of technology. Before enrolling chalmers
          I had never written single line of code, however I quickly fell in love with problem solving aspect while working together
          with friends/colleauges. Currently I'm working part-time at Volvo Cars as a forklift operator. However I'm actively looking for new
          and exciting opportunities to gain experience working with software.</p>
          <p>When I am not at Chalmers or working i like to spend my free time working out, reading and spending time with friends and family.
          Additionally what most people don't know, and will only know because they are reading this, is that i'm certified lifeguard with real-
          world experience. That is all for now. You can find my contact information in the "contact" tab above.
