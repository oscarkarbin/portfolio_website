        <h3>PayMe (Chalmers group project)</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/dinohromic/PayMe2.0" target="_blank" id="colorAqua">Github Link</a>
        <p>
          PayMe is a mobile application made natively for android. It was made with: 
          object oriented Java, XML, Junit and JSON in android studios
          The purpose of the app was to solve the issue of keeping
          track of debts to other people. It works by creating groups
          of people that participate in events, a dinner for example, where someone
          has paid for someone else (i.e. a debt is created). An algorithm then calculates
          outgoing and ingoing debts for each member in the group. This debt can later on be
          settled through the app.

        <h3>This website :) (Individual project)</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/oscarkarbin/portfolio_website" target="_blank" id="colorAqua">Github Link</a>
        <p>
          The reason behind this website is to learn/try basic web development. It is made with:
          JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The inspiration behind the theme is typical 'terminal' with added
          ascii-art-text. The idea is that you navigate my website the same way you would navigate a
          terminal. I also added simple subsection of the website that works with mobile devices
          Please keep in mind that this is my first time using HTML, JavaScript and CSS
